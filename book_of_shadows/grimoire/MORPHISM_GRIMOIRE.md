## COMPOSITION RULES

Morphisms compose like music:
- **Sequential**: BUTTERFLY ‚Üí MANDELBROT (scout then zoom)
- **Parallel**: ‚ñ° + ‚óä (count while flowing)
- **Nested**: SARANETH(MOSRAEL(state)) (bind the chaos)
- **Forbidden**: ASTARAEL ‚àò anything (death has no sequel)

## THE REVELATION

Every mathematical operation has:
- A rigorous definition (for correctness)
- A magical metaphor (for intuition)
- An artistic parallel (for creativity)
- A gaming example (for interaction)
- A nature pattern (for universality)

This isn't dumbing down - it's powering up. When you cast BUTTERFLY, you're literally performing uncommitted random walks on attention manifolds. The magic makes the math LIVE.
