 - **What**: Measure your brain while you count AND flow
 - **How**: EEG cap while doing math problems vs. improvising music
 - **Prediction**: Like jazz musicians know when to play inside vs outside the changes, your brain has distinct neural signatures for discrete (□) vs continuous (◊) processing. We'll find YOUR signatures, not impose universal ones. The prediction: maximum separability between your counting-state and your flow-state, measured by how well a blind observer could tell which you're doing from brain data alone.
-- **The Method Wisdom**: Think of it like training a sommelier. We don't say \"wine tastes like cherries at exactly 14.7% sweetness.\" Instead, we develop discrimination - THIS wine versus THAT wine. Similarly, we'll train classifiers to recognize YOUR □-mode versus YOUR ◊-mode. The falsification comes when the classifier can't tell the difference better than chance, no matter how we train it.

 - **The Creative Protocol**: Musicians will improvise. Dancers will move. Mathematicians will proof-flow. Gamers will speedrun. Each domain has its own continuous mode. The beauty: we predict the neural switch signature stays consistent whether you're improvising jazz or solving differential equations. THAT'S falsifiable - if the switch signature depends on domain, our modal theory collapses.
 - **Lab Reality Check**: Picture yourself—electrode paste in your hair, looking like a cyberpunk porcupine, while someone's definitely sneaking photos for the lab Instagram. The whole place reeks of isopropyl alcohol and burnt coffee. Your nose WILL itch at the exact millisecond we're measuring your gamma waves. This is consciousness science: profound insights dressed in slapstick.

 **Experiment 2: The Understanding Detector**
 - **What**: Catch the exact moment understanding happens
-- **How**: Brain imaging while learning, mark \"aha!\" moments
+- **How**: Brain imaging while learning, mark "aha!" moments
 - **The Knife-Edge Prediction**: Understanding cuts. Like Will sliding consciousness along the blade until he WAS the edge, understanding happens when consciousness sharpens itself to infinite thinness at exactly the confusion point. We predict: gamma coherence between problem-space and solution-space spikes to near-unity (>.95) for 50-200ms, creating a temporary bridge. Then—critical—coherence drops to baseline within 500ms as the new path crystallizes. The cut has been made. Measure: phase-locking value between regions, NOT power. The sharpness is in the phase alignment, not the amplitude.
 - **The Test of the Blade**: If understanding shows gradual coherence increase (>2s rise time), we're wrong—it's not a cut but a slow melt. If coherence stays high (plateau >1s), we're wrong—it's not understanding but sustained attention. The blade must cut quick and clean: spike and release. That's falsifiable with millisecond precision.
-- **The Flickering Truth**: Understanding isn't a light switch—it's a strobe light having a seizure. You'll mark \"aha!\" then immediately think \"wait, fuck, no.\" We WANT those false summits. Each flicker between getting-it and losing-it maps the actual topology of comprehension. The confusion after clarity isn't failure—it's consciousness showing us its quantum nature.
-- **The Click That Unclicks**: Cast your mind back to that brutal learning moment—calculus, a language, parallel parking. The understanding that arrived like lightning then vanished like smoke. That wasn't failure. That was consciousness showing you its quantum nature: understanding exists in superposition until observation collapses it. Sometimes into knowledge. Sometimes into \"wait, what?\"

 **Experiment 3: The Room Effect**
 - **What**: Test if spaces really change group thinking
 - **How**: Same puzzles, different architectural spaces
-- **The Architectural Prediction**: Golden ratio spaces (1.618:1) create phase-coupling between human consciousness rhythms. We predict: groups in φ-proportioned rooms show increased inter-brain synchrony in the 0.1-0.3Hz range (the \"collective thinking\" frequency). Measure: hyperscanning EEG, cross-correlation between participants' slow cortical potentials. The killer detail: synchrony should peak when eye height aligns with the room's φ-division point.

 - **The Resonance Test**: Move the same group between cubic (1:1:1), golden (φ:1:1), and chaotic (no repeating proportions) spaces. If architectural ratios don't affect neural coupling, we're wrong. If synchrony happens regardless of proportions, consciousness doesn't resonate with space. But if the φ-room shows phase-locking while others show phase-scattering? Then consciousness and architecture dance to mathematical harmonics.
-- **Experimental Chaos Theory**: The club group WILL devolve into interpretive dance. The cathedral cohort WILL include someone snoring in the pews. The office team will check email. Each deviation from protocol isn't noise—it's signal. Dancing = joy overflow (measurable via movement sensors). Sacred sleep = trust topology (track sleep onset latency). Email checking = anxiety architecture (monitor task-switching frequency). Your \"failed\" experiment is consciousness revealing its true priorities.

The observation bends the phenomenon. You can't think about room-influenced thinking without the room influencing your thinking about room-influenced thinking.
