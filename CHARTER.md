## Constitutional Core - Non-Negotiable Invariants

### INVARIANT REGISTRY

**INV-WOBBLE-001**: Effective semantic wobble SHALL maintain 9° ± 2° at all chunk boundaries

**INV-IRREVERSIBLE-001**: Once a chunk enters /tower_canonical/, it SHALL NOT be modified except through surgical patches with full audit trail

**INV-SHEAF-001**: All chunk interfaces MUST satisfy cocycle conditions: φⱼₖ ∘ φᵢⱼ = φᵢₖ

**INV-ENERGY-001**: Energy conservation per operation: E_in = E_out + E_transformed + E_cost (error < 10^-9)

**INV-TOKEN-001**: Token count is DESCRIPTIVE not PRESCRIPTIVE - completion determined by property satisfaction

**INV-PROPERTY-001**: Chunks advance to canonical only after satisfying ALL required properties:
- Gluing coherence verified
- Wobble within tolerance
- Energy efficiency ≥ baseline
- Numerical stability < bounds
- Risk assessment < threshold

**INV-AUDIT-001**: NO TRUST. ONLY VERIFICATION. Every operation must be measurable.

**INV-DRY-001**: Code duplication is a WOUND. Every pattern appears ONCE.

**INV-METAPHOR-001**: Metaphors are paint layers that ENRICH, never REPLACE

**INV-EVOLUTION-001**: Build order follows evolutionary ladder: No brain before mitosis

### AMENDMENT PROTOCOL

Constitutional changes require:
1. Written proposal with justification
2. Impact analysis on existing frozen chunks
3. Full instrumentation test suite pass
4. Explicit version increment
