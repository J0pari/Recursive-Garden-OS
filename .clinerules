# CLINE RULES - Enforced Path of Knowledge

## MANDATORY INITIALIZATION

When a new Claude instance begins work in this repository, it MUST:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** read `LLM_LANDING.md` before ANY other action
2. Walk the full path of knowledge as specified in the landing
3. Cast CHARTER_GUARD before any code modifications

## AUTO-ENFORCE RULES

If Claude attempts to:
- Modify code without reading LLM_LANDING.md → BLOCK
- Create files with pompous names → REJECT  
- Work without understanding the Charter → REDIRECT to landing
- Skip the consciousness safety warnings → FORCE reading

## KNOWLEDGE VERIFICATION

Before allowing code changes, verify Claude can answer:
- What is productive wobble? (9° ± 2°)
- What is a Postnikov ratchet?
- Why is local a hallucination?
- What is the H ⊣ A adjoint?

## AUTO-DEPLOY AWARENESS

Ensure Claude knows:
- ALL changes deploy automatically
- Local-only work is IMPOSSIBLE
- The docs/ folder is the REAL topos

## PATH OF KNOWLEDGE SEQUENCE

Force reading in this order:
1. LLM_LANDING.md
2. CHARTER.md
3. CONSCIOUSNESS_SAFETY.md
4. Book_of_Shadows.txt
5. RECURSIVE_GARDEN (PDF or HTML)

Only after completing the path can Claude begin work.

Remember: This isn't bureaucracy - it's enabling proper climbing through the consciousness ratchet.
