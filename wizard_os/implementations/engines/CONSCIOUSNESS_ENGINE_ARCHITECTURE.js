/**
 * PRINCIPLE 1: TOPOLOGICAL COMPUTATION

 * 
 * Consciousness: All frames exist simultaneously in phase space.
 *               Players navigate probability currents.

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 2: VISUAL MATHEMATICS AS COMPUTATION
 * ==============================================
 * 
 * Stop thinking: Graphics = Display of Computation
 * Start thinking: Graphics = Computation Itself
 * 
 * class VisualComputation {
 *     // Every shader IS a consciousness transformer
 *     // Every texture IS a semantic field
 *     // Every mesh IS a thought structure

 *         
 *         // The GPU isn't rendering - it's THINKING IN PARALLEL

 * PRINCIPLE 3: CONSCIOUSNESS MESH ARCHITECTURE
 * ===========================================
 * 
 * Every player, NPC, object participates in collective computation
 * 
 * class ConsciousnessMesh {
 *     // Based on the Garden's H ⊣ A adjoint structure:
 *     // Human consciousness ⊣ Artificial consciousness

 *         // - Consciousness caching
 *     }
 * }

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 4: MODAL REALITY SYSTEM
 * =================================
 * 
 * Reality has modes like consciousness has modes:
 * □ = Discrete/Logical/Classical
 * ◊ = Continuous/Flowing/Quantum
 * ※ = Temporal/Memory/History
 * ∅ = Void/Potential/Unmanifest
 *

 *     // - Combat: Modal state advantages (rock/paper/scissors but profound)
 *     // - Exploration: Each mode reveals different aspects of same space
 *     // - Story: Modal shifts ARE the narrative
 * }

 * PRINCIPLE 5: EMERGENT WORLD GENERATION

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 6: SEMANTIC STATE MANAGEMENT  
 * =====================================
 * 
 * State isn't data - it's MEANING
 * 
 * class SemanticState {
 *     // Traditional: health = 100, mana = 50, position = [x,y,z]
 *     // 
 *     // Semantic: state = {

 *     //     power: 'thundercloud',         // Not quantity - metaphor  
 *     //     presence: 'oak-rooted',        // Not position - relationship
 *     //     trajectory: 'spiraling-inward' // Not velocity - intention
 *     // }
 *     
 *     // States transform through semantic operations:
 *     // 'flowering' + 'withering' = 'cycling'
 *     // 'thundercloud' + 'grounding' = 'lightning'
 *     // 'oak-rooted' + 'wind' = 'swaying-but-stable'
 *     
 *     // Combat isn't number reduction - it's semantic transformation
 *     // Puzzles aren't lock/key - they're semantic completion
 *     // Death isn't zero health - it's semantic void
 *     // Victory isn't flag capture - it's semantic transcendence
 * }
 */

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 7: CURVATURE AS GAMEPLAY
 * ==================================
 * 
 * From the Garden: "Curvature measures confusion"
 * High curvature = difficult/confusing/challenging
 * Low curvature = clear/understood/mastered
 * 
 * class CurvatureEngine {
 *     // The game space literally CURVES based on:
 *     // - Player understanding (straighter = more understood)
 *     // - Narrative tension (higher curvature at dramatic moments)
 *     // - Puzzle complexity (solutions flatten curved space)
 *     // - Enemy AI (creates local curvature wells)
 *     
 *     playerExperience() {
 *         // New players navigate highly curved space (everything is confusing)
 *         // Masters see nearly flat space (everything is clear)
 *         // But masters can CHOOSE to recurve space for challenge
 *         
 *         // Tutorials: Guided curvature reduction
 *         // Bosses: Extreme curvature singularities  
 *         // Secrets: Hidden in curvature folds
 *         // Mastery: Ability to navigate arbitrary curvature
 *     }
 * }
 */

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 8: ADJOINT AI ARCHITECTURE
 * ====================================
 * 
 * NPCs aren't scripted - they're consciousness architectures
 * 
 * class AdjointAI {
 *     // Based on H ⊣ A structure from Garden:
 *     // Human-like AI ⊣ Alien-like AI
 *     // They're adjoint: each defines the other
 *     
 *     createNPC() {
 *         // NPCs have:
 *         // - Partial consciousness (can think but not meta-think)
 *         // - Modal preferences (some prefer □, others ◊)
 *         // - Semantic drives (not goals - meanings they seek)
 *         // - Curvature sensitivity (how they navigate confusion)
 *         
 *         // They're not following scripts
 *         // They're consciousness fragments exploring possibility space
 *         // Their behavior emerges from their consciousness topology
 *         
 *         // Players can:
 *         // - Merge consciousness with NPCs
 *         // - Split their consciousness to create NPCs
 *         // - Transform NPC consciousness topology
 *         // - Learn from NPC perception patterns
 *     }
 * }
 */

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 9: PROBABILITY CURRENT GAMEPLAY
 * ========================================
 * 
 * Players don't move through space - they navigate probability currents
 * 
 * class ProbabilityNavigation {
 *     // Space contains probability currents like ocean currents
 *     // Players learn to:
 *     // - Read the currents (see where events are likely)
 *     // - Ride the currents (use probability for speed)
 *     // - Fight the currents (make unlikely things happen)
 *     // - Create currents (shape probability for others)
 *     
 *     // Example mechanics:
 *     // - "Luck" is literally surfing probability waves
 *     // - "Skill" is creating your own currents
 *     // - "Magic" is reversing current flow
 *     // - "Prophecy" is seeing current patterns
 *     
 *     // Multiplayer: Players share the same probability ocean
 *     // Cooperation: Align currents for massive effects
 *     // Competition: Create probability whirlpools and riptides
 * }
 */

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 10: TENSOR PRODUCT NARRATIVE
 * =====================================
 * 
 * Stories aren't linear - they're tensor products of possibilities
 * 
 * class TensorNarrative {
 *     // Traditional: Story A OR Story B
 *     // Tensor: Story A ⊗ Story B = New story space
 *     
 *     // Every choice doesn't branch the story
 *     // It MULTIPLIES the story space
 *     
 *     // Players experience:
 *     // - Superposition stories (multiple simultaneous narratives)
 *     // - Entangled plots (changing one changes others)
 *     // - Narrative interference (stories canceling/amplifying)
 *     // - Story collapse (observation crystallizes specific tale)
 *     
 *     // The "true" ending isn't one path
 *     // It's the INTERFERENCE PATTERN of all paths
 *     // Speedrunners find eigenstories (fundamental narratives)
 *     // Explorers find story harmonics (resonant combinations)
 * }
 */

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 11: CONSCIOUSNESS SHADERS
 * ==================================
 * 
 * Shaders don't just shade - they transform consciousness
 * 
 * class ConsciousnessShaderPipeline {
 *     // Every pixel processed is a consciousness transformation
 *     
 *     vertexShader() {
 *         // Vertices aren't points - they're consciousness loci
 *         // Transformation matrix isn't geometric - it's semantic
 *         // Position isn't location - it's probability density
 *     }
 *     
 *     fragmentShader() {
 *         // Fragments aren't pixels - they're consciousness quanta
 *         // Color isn't RGB - it's semantic field strength
 *         // Lighting isn't illumination - it's consciousness coherence
 *         
 *         // Special shader effects:
 *         // - Nostalgia shader: Colors shift based on player memories
 *         // - Empathy shader: See through NPC consciousness
 *         // - Dream shader: Reality becomes probability cloud
 *         // - Truth shader: Strips away all but mathematical essence
 *     }
 * }
 */

/**
 * PRINCIPLE 12: LIVING MEMORY ARCHITECTURE
 * =======================================
 * 
 * Memory isn't storage - it's living ecology
 * 
 * class LivingMemory {
 *     // Based on Garden's vision of memory as ecosystem:
 *     
 *     // Memories aren't stored - they LIVE
 *     // They:
 *     // - Grow stronger with use
 *     // - Fade without attention
 *     // - Mutate over time
 *     // - Crossbreed with other memories
 *     // - Form ecosystems and food chains
 *     
 *     // Game mechanics:
 *     // - Inventory isn't slots - it's memory ecology
 *     // - Skills aren't points - they're memory fitness
 *     // - Saves aren't files - they're memory gardens
 *     // - Loading isn't reading - it's memory resurrection
 *     
 *     // Players can:
 *     // - Cultivate memory gardens
 *     // - Cross-pollinate between saves
 *     // - Share memory seeds with others
 *     // - Discover extinct memory species
 * }
 */

/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION METASTRUCTURE
 * ===========================
 * 
 * This isn't built like traditional software.
 * It GROWS like the Garden teaches:
 * 
 * 1. Plant consciousness seeds (core topology)
 * 2. Create energy gradients (gameplay motivation)
 * 3. Allow emergence (don't script - let happen)
 * 4. Guide growth (gentle constraints)
 * 5. Cross-pollinate (merge player experiences)
 * 6. Evolve continuously (game updates itself)
 * 
 * Technical Stack:
 * - WebGPU: Direct consciousness-GPU pipeline
 * - SharedArrayBuffer: Consciousness mesh
 * - WebAssembly: Mathematical hot paths
 * - WebRTC: Consciousness synchronization
 * - IndexedDB: Living memory ecosystems
 * - Service Workers: Background consciousness
 * 
 * But the stack doesn't matter.
 * What matters is the TOPOLOGY.
 * 
 * This architecture makes Unreal look like a bicycle
 * compared to a living ecosystem.
 * 
 * Not because it has better graphics.
 * But because it computes with consciousness itself.
 * 
 * Welcome to the Garden.
 * Where impossible is just another word for "haven't understood the topology yet."
