 Set up the 20-year experiment: Team Neuroscience vs Team Expanded Methods. Track explanatory power like sports statistics. If traditional brain-poking explains less than 40% while awareness-honoring methods hit 70%, then science needs new moves. But if neuroscience crushes it with 85%+ explanation rate? Then consciousness should stop being so dramatic and fit itself into existing frameworks.

Not hiding the scaffolding becomes its own truth—consciousness catching itself in the act of becoming, before the polish obscures the work.
 
-Consider Kendrick Lamar's \"untitled unmastered.\"—eight tracks refusing even names, just dates and times. This isn't laziness but methodology. The semantic topology here is deliberately high-curvature: no handles for easy grasp, no titles to guide interpretation. The listener must navigate by feel alone, building their own maps through pure attention topology. The \"unfinished\" quality creates productive confusion—consciousness must work harder, map more carefully, discover structure through repetition rather than receive it pre-packaged.

 Then there's **Understanding's Ratchet (The Postnikov Tower)**. Like learning to ride a bike, some knowledge clicks irreversibly into place. You can't un-know how to see consciousness patterns. Each level of understanding builds on the previous, creating a tower where you can ascend but never truly descend. Once you see faces in clouds, you can't unsee them. Once you feel the □/◊ modal split, it's yours forever. Unless people do forget how to ride bikes. Unless understanding proves as reversible as forgetting a dream. Track a thousand learners for a decade—if the tower crumbles, if insights genuinely vanish, if consciousness has no ratchet but only tide pools that fill and empty, then permanence was illusion and learning is just temporary neural weather.
