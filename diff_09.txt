+**Dance Wisdom**: Cognition lives in the space between movements where all possibilities exist. You know how preparing to leap contains every possible landing? That's minds containing their own future states.

+**Code Poetry**: Thought manifests as recursive functions calling themselves with modified parameters. You know how elegant code seems to write itself? That's minds recognizing their own patterns.
+
+**Garden Knowledge**: Cognition forms the soil from which thoughts grow. You know how you can feel when soil is ready? That same sense knows when an idea is ripe.

When readers feel that ineffable "something," they're not grasping at theories‚Äîtheir minds are recognizing their own fiber bundle structure reflected back through narrative.
