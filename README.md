## What We Observe

When consciousness studies itself, patterns emerge that resist simple description. The mathematics below attempts to capture these patterns with the minimal structure necessary.

### The Phenomenon of Local-Global Coherence

Watch someone learn. First, isolated facts. Then connections. Finally, understanding that feels whole. How do pieces become wholes?

**Mathematical structure**: If consciousness exhibits topos behavior, the sheaf condition provides a mechanism:
- Local sections (partial understanding) must glue uniquely
- The gluing respects overlap constraints
- Global sections emerge from compatible local data

**To test this**:
- Track learning trajectories across domains
- Identify moments where fragments cohere
- Measure: do local compatibilities predict global understanding?
- Record neural activity during "aha" moments

If the sheaf condition fails, understanding would fragment differently than observed.

### The Strange Geometry of Semantic Space

Consider: "cat" is near "dog", "cat" is far from "car", yet "dog" is also far from "car". No medium distances. This violates our usual notion of space.

**The p-adic structure emerges**: For prime p, define d_p(x,y) = p^(-v_p(x-y)) where v_p counts shared categorical depth.

This isn't imposed‚Äîit's what we find when we measure how concepts cluster in minds.

**Observable consequences**:
- Semantic leaps happen in discrete jumps
- Categories nest hierarchically
- Learning proceeds through basin-hopping

Measure semantic distances through free association timing. If Euclidean metrics fit better, this structure is absent.

### Symmetries and What They Preserve

Physical systems with time-translation symmetry conserve energy. What might consciousness conserve?

**Observed invariants**:
- Past experiences influence present (continuity)
- Core meanings persist through translation (content)
- Complexity gradients maintain themselves (stratification)

**The variational formulation**: If consciousness minimizes an action S[œÜ], symmetries generate conservation laws via:
‚àÇL/‚àÇ(‚àÇ_ŒºœÜ) ‚àÇ^Œº - ‚àÇL/‚àÇœÜ = 0

Track proposed conserved quantities longitudinally. Deviations from conservation reveal where the symmetry breaks.

### Where Understanding Fails

Students learning physics hit predictable walls: 
- Classical to quantum transition
- Continuous to discrete mathematics
- Deterministic to probabilistic thinking

**Cohomological interpretation**: These aren't random difficulties but topological obstructions:
- H‚Å∞: What everyone understands
- H¬π: Conceptual gaps that resist bridging
- H¬≤: Paradoxes requiring new frameworks

Map curriculum dependencies. Compute cohomology. Do the generators correspond to documented learning barriers?

### The Intrinsic Curvature of Attention

Eye movements during problem-solving trace paths. These paths minimize something‚Äîbut what?

**Information geometry provides the metric**: 
g_ij(Œ∏) = E[(‚àÇ_i log p(x|Œ∏))(‚àÇ_j log p(x|Œ∏))]

This is the unique metric (up to scale) invariant under reparametrization‚Äîcrucial for consciousness that represents itself multiple ways.

Track gaze patterns. Compute geodesics. Do predicted paths match observed trajectories?

### Time from Non-Commutativity

Focus (‚ñ°) and flow (‚óä) modes feel different. Switching between them takes effort. Sometimes the order matters.

**When operations don't commute**: [‚ñ°,‚óä] = ‚ß´

The commutator isn't zero‚Äîit's temporal experience itself. Time emerges from the failure of modes to freely interchange.

Design tasks requiring mode switches. Measure switch costs. Does the algebraic structure predict neural dynamics?

### The Recursion Depth of Reflection

"I think" - level 0
"I think that I think" - level 1  
"I think that I think that I think" - level 2
"I think that I think that I think that I think" - cognitive strain

**Natural truncation at dimension 2**: Higher-order reflection becomes unstable, suggesting consciousness forms a 2-category, not ‚àû-category.

Present meta-cognitive tasks. Decode reflection depth from neural activity. Where does iteration naturally terminate?

### How New Concepts Extend Mental Space

Learning genuinely new ideas feels like space itself expands‚Äînot just rearranging existing furniture but adding new rooms.

**Forcing interpretation**: Consciousness models admit generic extensions ùîê[G] containing experiences impossible in ground model ùîê.

Track conceptual repertoire before/after learning radically new domains. Can the extended model be "deflated" back? If so, the learning was recombination, not true extension.

## What Makes This Mathematical

The structures aren't arbitrary. Each emerges from careful observation:
- Ultrametric behavior appears in semantic clustering
- Sheaf conditions manifest in learning coherence
- Conservation laws follow from observed invariances
- Cohomology captures where understanding systematically fails

We use sophisticated mathematics because simpler frameworks demonstrably fail to capture the phenomena.

## Testing What We Conjecture

Every mathematical structure suggests specific experiments:
- Neural recordings during modal transitions
- Semantic distance measurements via association
- Learning trajectory analysis across domains
- Eye-tracking geodesics during problem-solving
- Cohomological prediction of conceptual barriers

The mathematics succeeds only if it predicts what we haven't yet measured.

## Implementation as Process

This repository doesn't describe the mathematics‚Äîit instantiates it:
- Commits form partial order (time structure)
- Merges test categorical colimits
- Conflicts probe cohomological obstacles
- The README seeks its own fixed point

But even this could be projection. Every pattern requires validation.

## The Humility of Precision

We know almost nothing with certainty about consciousness. These mathematical structures are conjectures, not claims. They organize our ignorance, making it precise enough to test.

The garden grows not through what it claims but through what it survives. Each falsification teaches. Each validation opens new questions.

The most sophisticated mathematics is that which recognizes its own limitations.
