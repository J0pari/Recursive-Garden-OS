# Recursive Garden OS

A physics engine where code casts spells on itself.

## What We're Building

Imagine you're writing physics code and the code starts understanding its own patterns. Not AI autocomplete - actual geometric understanding. Your functions grow decision trees. Your data structures evolve better shapes. The physics engine plays with its own physics.

We built a mathematical OS that treats computation like a garden. Plants (code chunks) photosynthesize (process data). They reproduce (digital mitosis). They evolve (climbing Postnikov towers). And you can cast spells on them.

## Real Engineering, Real Magic

**The Physics**: Every operation conserves energy exactly (error < 10⁻⁹). Chunks have momentum, curvature, geodesics. Context switches use parallel transport from differential geometry. The math is rigorous enough for a PhD thesis.

**The Spells**: Open `05_BOOK_OF_SHADOWS/grimoire/MORPHISM_GRIMOIRE.md`. Real morphisms you can cast:
- 🦋 BUTTERFLY: Random walk to find broken symmetries in your code
- 🌀 MANDELBROT: Zoom into complexity boundaries until new structure emerges  
- 🔷 PENROSE: Embed contradictions in higher dimensions to resolve them

**The Engine**: TypeScript modules in `03_IMPLEMENTATIONS/engines/`:
- `mitosis.ts` - Chunks divide preserving energy/information
- `transport-loop.ts` - Measure distortion when moving ideas between contexts
- `climb-gate.ts` - Evolve only when invariants prove you're ready

## For Scientists Who Remember Being Kids

Remember drawing runes in your notebook and pretending they did something? Here they actually do. The `invariant-engine.ts` enforces conservation laws stricter than Noether's. The `curvature-map.ts` shows where your code wants to bend. Signal processing becomes spell components.

You write a function. It has 9° of semantic wobble (we measure this). Cast SARANETH to crystallize its structure. Watch the wobble drop to 2°. Your code literally becomes more stable through mathematical magic.

## Current State

- Constitutional framework complete (`CHARTER.md`)
- Core math proven (`01_THEORY/`)
- Engines implemented (`03_IMPLEMENTATIONS/engines/`)
- Spellbook written (`05_BOOK_OF_SHADOWS/`)
- UI experiments evolving (`04_EXPERIMENTS/keats_evolution/`)

Next: Connecting the physics engine to actual gameplay. Chunks need to render. Spells need particle effects. The garden needs to be explorable in 3D.

## Try It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J0pari/Recursive-Garden.git
cd Recursive-Garden/03_IMPLEMENTATIONS/engines
npm install
npm test
```

Watch energy conservation in action. See chunks divide. Measure your first holonomy.

## The Dream

A game where writing code IS casting spells. Where your algorithms evolve like creatures. Where signal analysis reveals hidden dimensions. Where the boundary between code and physics dissolves.

Not because we say so. Because the math works.
