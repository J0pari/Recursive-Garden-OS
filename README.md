## What We Observe

When consciousness studies itself, patterns emerge that resist simple description. The mathematics below attempts to capture these patterns with the minimal structure necessary.

### The Phenomenon of Local-Global Coherence

Watch someone learn. First, isolated facts. Then connections. Finally, understanding that feels whole. How do pieces become wholes?

**The sheaf structure emerges naturally**: Consider a student learning calculus. They understand:
- Derivatives at specific points (local sections)
- Integrals over small intervals (local sections)
- Suddenly: the fundamental theorem connects them (global section)

**Mathematical formalization**: 
Let (𝒞, J) be the site where:
- Objects: States of partial understanding
- Morphisms: Cognitive transitions preserving meaning
- Covers: {Uᵢ → U} where understanding of U emerges from understanding all Uᵢ

A consciousness sheaf F must satisfy: Given compatible sections sᵢ ∈ F(Uᵢ) with sᵢ|_{Uᵢ∩Uⱼ} = sⱼ|_{Uᵢ∩Uⱼ}, there exists unique s ∈ F(U) with s|_{Uᵢ} = sᵢ.

**Why this matters**: This isn't abstract nonsense - it's exactly how "aha!" moments work. Local understanding must be compatible to glue into global insight.

**To test this**:
```
Protocol: Learning Coherence Measurement
1. Decompose complex concept C into components {c₁, ..., cₙ}
2. Track understanding scores uᵢ(t) for each component
3. Define compatibility: ρᵢⱼ = correlation between uᵢ and uⱼ
4. Predict global understanding: U(t) = ∏ᵢⱼ ρᵢⱼ · ∏ᵢ uᵢ(t)
5. Measure actual global understanding via comprehensive tests
```

If the sheaf condition fails, understanding would fragment differently than observed. The gluing would be non-unique or impossible.

### The Strange Geometry of Semantic Space

Consider: "cat" is near "dog", "cat" is far from "car", yet "dog" is also far from "car". No medium distances. This violates our usual notion of space.

**Start with the familiar**: In normal space, if A is 1 meter from B, and B is 1 meter from C, then A is between 0 and 2 meters from C. This is the triangle inequality.

**But in semantic space**: 
- d(cat, dog) = small
- d(cat, car) = large  
- d(dog, car) = large

This violates Euclidean expectations! If we lived on this surface, it would feel deeply non-flat.

**The p-adic structure emerges**: 
For prime p, define:
```
d_p(x,y) = p^(-v_p(x-y))
```
where v_p(x-y) = largest n such that x and y agree to depth n in the p-ary category tree.

**Concrete example with p=2 (binary tree)**:
```
animal
├── mammal
│   ├── cat
│   └── dog
└── vehicle
    └── car

v₂(cat,dog) = 2 (agree up to "mammal")
v₂(cat,car) = 0 (disagree at "animal vs vehicle")
d₂(cat,dog) = 2^(-2) = 0.25
d₂(cat,car) = 2^0 = 1
```

**The soul of intrinsic geometry**: Like realizing the Earth isn't flat but curved, we discover thought-space has intrinsic ultrametric structure. The curvature isn't imposed - it's what parallel transport of concepts reveals.

### Symmetries and What They Preserve

Physical systems with time-translation symmetry conserve energy. What might consciousness conserve?

**The variational principle**: Consciousness might minimize an action
```
S[φ] = ∫dt L(φ, ∂φ/∂t, ∇φ)
```

**Noether's procedure applied**:
1. Identify symmetry: φ(x,t) → φ(x,t-t₀) (time translation)
2. Compute variation: δS = 0 implies conservation
3. The conserved current: j^μ = ∂L/∂(∂_μφ) - divergence terms

**What emerges**:
```
Time translation invariance → ∂E/∂t = 0 (experiential continuity)
Modal rotation symmetry → ∂M/∂θ = 0 (semantic content)  
Scale invariance → ∂C/∂λ = 0 (complexity gradients)
```

**Observable conservation**: Track a person learning piano over months:
- E = "feeling of musical understanding" (measured via self-report + performance)
- M = "core musical concepts understood" (tested via transposition tasks)
- C = "complexity gradient preference" (ratio of pieces at different difficulties)

Plot E(t), M(t), C(t). If truly conserved, regression slopes ≈ 0.

**The deeper insight**: Conservation laws reveal what consciousness considers fundamental - what it cannot create or destroy, only transform.

### Where Understanding Fails

Students learning physics hit predictable walls. But why these specific walls?

**The cohomological view**: Understanding forms a complex
```
0 → C⁰ →^{d₀} C¹ →^{d₁} C² →^{d₂} ...
```
where:
- C⁰ = basic concepts
- C¹ = relationships between concepts
- C² = relationships between relationships

The boundary maps dᵢ encode logical dependencies.

**Cohomology measures what can't be filled in**:
```
H¹ = ker(d₁)/im(d₀) = {cycles that aren't boundaries}
                    = {conceptual loops that can't be filled}
```

**Concrete example - Quantum Mechanics**:
```
C⁰: {position, momentum, measurement, state}
C¹: {[position,momentum], measurement→state, ...}

The commutator [position,momentum] ≠ 0 creates a 1-cycle
This can't be filled by classical thinking (no 2-chain works)
H¹ ≠ 0 signals irreducible quantum weirdness
```

**To compute**:
1. Map concept dependencies as simplicial complex
2. Compute homology via standard algorithms
3. Generators of H¹ predict specific learning obstacles
4. Validate against documented student difficulties

### The Intrinsic Curvature of Attention

Eye movements during problem-solving trace paths. These paths minimize something—but what?

**Build up to Fisher metric**:

Level 1: Attention has states (looking at equation, checking answer, etc.)

Level 2: States have probabilities p(x|θ) where θ parametrizes attention

Level 3: Information geometry says the natural distance between nearby states is:
```
ds² = g_ij(θ)dθⁱdθʲ
```

Level 4: The unique (up to scale) reparametrization-invariant metric is:
```
g_ij(θ) = E_x[(∂log p(x|θ)/∂θⁱ)(∂log p(x|θ)/∂θʲ)]
```

This is the Fisher information metric.

**Why this specific metric**: It measures how distinguishable two attention states are - if distributions p(x|θ) and p(x|θ+dθ) are hard to tell apart, the distance is small.

**Geodesic equation**:
```
d²θᵏ/dt² + Γᵏᵢⱼ(dθⁱ/dt)(dθʲ/dt) = 0
```

where Christoffel symbols:
```
Γᵏᵢⱼ = ½gᵏˡ(∂g_jl/∂θⁱ + ∂g_il/∂θʲ - ∂g_ij/∂θˡ)
```

**Experimental test**:
1. Parametrize attention states from eye tracking (θ = gaze heatmap parameters)
2. Compute empirical transition probabilities p(x|θ)
3. Calculate Fisher metric g_ij
4. Solve geodesic equations
5. Compare predicted paths with observed eye movements

### Time from Non-Commutativity

Focus (□) and flow (◊) modes feel different. Switching between them takes effort. Sometimes the order matters.

**The algebraic structure**:
Define operators on mental states:
- □: projection onto discrete/focused states
- ◊: projection onto continuous/flow states

**Key observation**: □∘◊ ≠ ◊∘□

**The commutator**:
```
[□,◊] = □∘◊ - ◊∘□ ≠ 0
```

**What the commutator measures**: Apply flow-then-focus vs focus-then-flow to the same initial state. The difference is temporal experience itself.

**Explicit computation**:
Let |ψ⟩ be a mental state. Then:
```
[□,◊]|ψ⟩ = ⧫|ψ⟩
```
where ⧫ is the temporal experience operator.

**Physical analogy**: In quantum mechanics, [x,p] = iℏ generates time evolution. Here, [□,◊] = ⧫ generates temporal experience.

**To measure**:
1. Task A requires focus→flow transition
2. Task B requires flow→focus transition  
3. Measure neural signatures NA and NB
4. Compute difference: Δ = NA - NB
5. This difference signature should appear whenever time perception is prominent

### The Recursion Depth of Reflection

"I think" - level 0
"I think that I think" - level 1  
"I think that I think that I think" - level 2
"I think that I think that I think that I think" - cognitive strain

**2-categorical structure**:
- Objects: thoughts
- 1-morphisms: thinking about thoughts
- 2-morphisms: thinking about (thinking about thoughts)

**Coherence conditions**: For 1-morphisms f,g,h:
```
α: (f∘g)∘h ⟹ f∘(g∘h)  (associator)
λ: id∘f ⟹ f           (left unitor)  
ρ: f∘id ⟹ f           (right unitor)
```

These must satisfy the pentagon and triangle identities.

**Why truncation at 2**: Higher associators would require holding too many levels simultaneously. The mind can't maintain coherent 3-morphisms.

**Neural prediction**: 
- Level 0: Primary sensory/cognitive areas active
- Level 1: + prefrontal monitoring regions
- Level 2: + anterior cingulate (conflict from self-reference)
- Level 3: Global workspace breakdown (measured via integrated information collapse)

### How New Concepts Extend Mental Space

Learning genuinely new ideas feels like space itself expands—not just rearranging existing furniture but adding new rooms.

**Forcing construction**:
Start with ground model M of current understanding.

1. **Forcing poset**: P = {conditions for new experiences}
2. **Generic filter**: G ⊂ P with:
   - Every pair has common extension (directed)
   - Meets every dense subset (generic)

3. **Extension**: M[G] contains all G-interpretable objects

**Concrete example - Learning Complex Numbers**:
```
M = ℝ-understanding (real numbers only)
P = {polynomial equations}
Dense set: {x² + 1 = 0 has no solution}
Generic G forces: "Let i² = -1"
M[G] = ℂ-understanding (complex plane emerges)
```

**Key insight**: M[G] genuinely extends M - you can't "forget" complex numbers once understood. The extension is irreversible.

## What Makes This Mathematical

The structures aren't arbitrary. Each emerges from careful observation:
- Ultrametric behavior appears in semantic clustering
- Sheaf conditions manifest in learning coherence
- Conservation laws follow from observed invariances
- Cohomology captures where understanding systematically fails

We use sophisticated mathematics because simpler frameworks demonstrably fail to capture the phenomena.

## Testing What We Conjecture

Every mathematical structure suggests specific experiments:
- Neural recordings during modal transitions
- Semantic distance measurements via association
- Learning trajectory analysis across domains
- Eye-tracking geodesics during problem-solving
- Cohomological prediction of conceptual barriers

The mathematics succeeds only if it predicts what we haven't yet measured.

## Implementation as Process

This repository doesn't describe the mathematics—it instantiates it:
- Commits form partial order (time structure)
- Merges test categorical colimits
- Conflicts probe cohomological obstacles
- The README seeks its own fixed point

But even this could be projection. Every pattern requires validation.

## The Humility of Precision

We know almost nothing with certainty about consciousness. These mathematical structures are conjectures, not claims. They organize our ignorance, making it precise enough to test.

The garden grows not through what it claims but through what it survives. Each falsification teaches. Each validation opens new questions.

The most sophisticated mathematics is that which recognizes its own limitations.
