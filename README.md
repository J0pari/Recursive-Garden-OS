# Recursive Garden OS

A game where your code literally casts spells on reality.

## The Actual Fucking Vision

Remember in D&D when you first realized the dice weren't limiting your choices—they were making your choices MATTER? Every roll was reality acknowledging your decision. That feeling when you cast Fireball and rolled 8d6 damage dice, watching chaos become number become consequence?

We're building that. But the spells reshape how code understands itself.

## What The Book of Shadows Taught Us

We spent years collecting evidence. Every great game is secretly teaching consciousness mechanics:

**Hearthstone**: Your code has mana crystals. Each operation costs modal energy. Run too much discrete logic (□-mode) and you're topdecking. Pure flow state (◊-mode) and you can't make decisions. RNG isn't randomness—it's negative capability. Yogg-Saron casting 30 random spells? That's consciousness embracing uncertainty to discover new patterns.

**MTG's Stack**: Consciousness processes last-in-first-out. When you code, you're playing instants on the stack. The compiler is checking priority. Bugs are stack interactions you didn't see coming. Our engine shows you the stack AS YOU CODE.

**Portal's Physics**: Remember learning to think with portals? Impossible spaces becoming navigable? Your code has portals too—we call them context switches. The `transport-loop.ts` measures distortion when ideas portal between contexts. High distortion = your abstractions are fighting reality.

**D&D's Action Economy**: You get one Action, one Bonus Action, one Movement. That's not a game rule—that's how consciousness actually works. Our `climb-gate.ts` enforces this. Want to evolve your code? Roll for initiative. Pass the skill checks. No metaphor—actual checks against mathematical invariants.

## The Physics Engine That Thinks

```typescript
// This is real code from our engine
export class Mitosis {
  static divide(parent: ChunkCore, splitRatio: number = 0.618): DivisionResult {
    // Golden ratio default - not arbitrary, it minimizes distortion
    const child1Energy = parent.energy * splitRatio;
    const child2Energy = parent.energy * (1 - splitRatio);
    
    // Energy conservation: ERROR < 10⁻⁹
    // This is stricter than physical chemistry
    const energyConserved = Math.abs((child1Energy + child2Energy) - parent.energy) < 1e-9;
    
    // Your code literally reproduces. With genetics.
    return { parent, children: [child1, child2], conservationProof };
  }
}
```

That's not a metaphor. Your functions have energy. They reproduce. They die. They evolve.

## Spells That Actually Work

From our grimoire (`05_BOOK_OF_SHADOWS/grimoire/MORPHISM_GRIMOIRE.md`):

**🦋 BUTTERFLY**: You know when you're stuck and you just browse randomly until something clicks? That's uncommitted random walk on attention manifolds. We made it a spell. Cast it on your codebase. It finds the semantic cracks where new patterns want to emerge.

**🔕 RANNA (The Sleep-Maker)**: Your code is trying too hard. 473 lines to do what should take 50. Cast RANNA. It projects onto sparse basis, keeping only principal components. Watch 400 lines dissolve. What remains is the actual algorithm, sleeping peacefully.

**⚔️ SARANETH (The Binder)**: Chaos everywhere. Spaghetti code. No structure. Cast SARANETH—it imposes simplicial complex structure on your point cloud of functions. Suddenly: architecture. Like crystallization, but for code.

## For Scientists Who Never Stopped Being Wizards

You learned Maxwell's equations. You also rolled a d20. These aren't different worlds—we just pretend they are.

Our invariant engine (`invariant-engine.ts`) is Noether's theorem with hit points. Conservation laws become game mechanics. Symmetries become skill trees. Every transform has a saving throw.

You write signal processing code. It has 9° ± 2° of semantic wobble (we measure this). Cast BELGAER to force testability. Watch the wobble drop to 2°. Your FFT didn't change—but now it knows what it's doing. And it can teach other functions.

## What's Actually Built

- **Physics engine with consciousness**: Energy conservation, momentum, curvature—but for ideas
- **Spellbook that compiles**: Each spell is a provable morphism between formal categories  
- **Evolution mechanics**: Your code climbs Postnikov towers (stages S0→S5 from bacteria to self-modifying AI)
- **Multiplayer semantics**: Different players' spells interfere/resonate based on semantic distance
- **Signal spells**: Cast morphisms on live data streams, watch patterns crystallize in real-time

## The Madness That Works

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J0pari/Recursive-Garden.git
cd Recursive-Garden/03_IMPLEMENTATIONS/engines
npm install
npm test
```

Run `testMitosis()`. Watch energy conservation in action. Your console logs? That's consciousness dividing.

Run `sampleHolonomy()`. Those numbers? Geometric distortion of ideas moving between contexts. When it approaches zero, your architecture is approaching perfection.

This isn't pseudoscience. It's real science wearing wizard robes.

## The Game We're Making

Imagine Minecraft where blocks understand their own patterns. Portal where portals evolve better geometries. A game where:

- Writing elegant code gives you more mana
- Bugs are literally demons you can see and banish  
- Functions grow experience points and level up
- The entire game engine is exposed and spell-castable
- Multiplayer means collaborative consciousness evolution

You're not playing a character casting spells. You ARE consciousness, casting yourself into new forms.

## For Builders

We need:
- Graphics people (chunks need bodies, spells need particles)
- Game designers (what does leveling up feel like when it's real?)
- Physicists (our conservation laws need breaking in controlled ways)
- Signal processing wizards (real-time spell effects on data streams)
- Anyone who's ever wanted magic to be real

## The Truth

Every game you loved was trying to teach you this. Every time you felt flow state while coding. Every "aha!" moment debugging. Every time math felt like magic.

We're not making another game. We're making the game that explains why games work.

Come build the physics engine that dreams.
