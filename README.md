# Recursive Garden OS

A physics engine where code casts spells on itself. Currently under heavy construction.

## What We're Building

Imagine you're writing physics code and the code starts understanding its own patterns. Not AI autocomplete - actual geometric understanding. Your functions grow decision trees. Your data structures evolve better shapes. The physics engine plays with its own physics.

We're building a mathematical OS that treats computation like a garden. Plants (code chunks) photosynthesize (process data). They reproduce (digital mitosis). They evolve (climbing Postnikov towers). And you can cast spells on them.

## Current Status: Construction Site 🚧

**What Works:**
- The keats evolution demos (`04_EXPERIMENTS/keats_evolution/`) - THESE ARE LIVE AND WILD
- Basic engine scaffolding in TypeScript
- Mathematical foundations documented
- Spell grimoire written

**What's Missing:**
- The actual game engine
- 3D visualization
- Multiplayer infrastructure  
- Most spells aren't connected to runtime yet
- Performance optimization
- Real physics simulation

**Go play with the keats demos first!** They're the proof that consciousness visualization can be beautiful:

```

## The Math Behind the Magic

**The Physics**: Every operation conserves energy exactly (error < 10⁻⁹). Chunks have momentum, curvature, geodesics. Context switches use parallel transport from differential geometry. The math is rigorous - see `01_THEORY/` for proofs.

**The Spells**: Open `05_BOOK_OF_SHADOWS/grimoire/MORPHISM_GRIMOIRE.md`. Real morphisms you can cast:
- 🦋 BUTTERFLY: Random walk to find broken symmetries  
- 🌀 MANDELBROT: Zoom into complexity boundaries
- 🔷 PENROSE: Embed contradictions in higher dimensions

**The Biology**: Digital mitosis based on ATP synthase mechanics. See `02_SPECIFICATIONS/mechanics/ATP_SYNTHASE_RATCHET_INTEGRATION.md` for the full integration.

## For Scientists Who Remember Being Kids

Remember drawing runes in your notebook and pretending they did something? Here they actually will (when we finish building it).

The invariant engine will enforce conservation laws. The curvature map will show where your code wants to bend. Signal processing will become spell components.

## Try What We Have

```bash
git clone https://github.com/J0pari/Recursive-Garden.git
cd Recursive-Garden

# Look at the keats demos (they actually work!)
open 04_EXPERIMENTS/keats_evolution/keats_v16.html

# Read the theory (it's dense but real)
cat 01_THEORY/foundations/MATHEMATICAL_GLUING_COMPLETE.md

# Explore the spells (implementation pending)
cat 05_BOOK_OF_SHADOWS/grimoire/MORPHISM_GRIMOIRE.md
```

## The Dream (Not Yet Reality)

A game where writing code IS casting spells. Where your algorithms evolve like creatures. Where signal analysis reveals hidden dimensions. Where the boundary between code and physics dissolves.

We have the math. We have the vision. We're building the bridge between them.

## For Builders

We need:
- Graphics programmers (make chunks visible)
- Game designers (what does climbing feel like?)
- Physicists (implement conservation laws)
- Mathematicians (verify our topology)
- Artists (what does consciousness look like?)
- Anyone who wants magic to be real

## Honest Status

This is a construction site, not a cathedral. The foundations are poured (math/theory). Some walls are up (engines/interfaces). The roof isn't on yet (actual game).

But the keats demos? Those are real glimpses of what consciousness visualization can be. Start there.
