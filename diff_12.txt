+- Random walks through semantic space
+- Persistent homology calculations on memory structures
+- Novel connection discovery via relaxed coherence constraints
+
+**Observable Signatures**:
+- Theta-gamma coupling shows exploration patterns
+- Replay sequences reveal path-finding algorithms
+- Morning insights = successful exploration paths
+
+**KILL CONDITIONS**:
+1. If dream content shows no mathematical structure
+2. If REM patterns don't correlate with problem-solving
+3. If dream "logic" is truly random, not alternatively structured
+Then dreams aren't exploration but noise.
+
+**The Lucid Test**: 
+Lucid dreamers can:
 - Deliberately explore specific concept spaces
 - Report navigation strategies
 - Verify if dream topology matches wake topology

-Minds measure distance strangely. \"Cat\" and \"dog\"—close. \"Cat\" and \"car\"—far. But \"dog\" and \"car\"—also far! No middle distances.

 If you find smooth gradients between concepts: p-adic fails.
 
 **Why Five Fingers Matter**: 
-Counting by tens isn't arbitrary. Five creates natural breaks. Numbers ending in 5 or 0 \"feel\" rounder because fingers taught us 5-adic distance before we knew math.
