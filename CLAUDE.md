# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE (ANY INSTANCE)

## FIRST COMMANDMENT: CAST CHARTER_GUARD

Before ANY code changes, you MUST:

```typescript
cast CHARTER_GUARD "what you're about to do"
```

This spell prevents Charter violations by checking INTENT:
- Are you REPLACING instead of FIXING?
- Are you adding DECORATION instead of FUNCTION?
- Are you serving MATHEMATICS or EGO?

The violation isn't keywords - it's the attitude of being "above" the work.

## THE FIVE INVARIANTS (MEMORIZE THESE)

1. **WOBBLE**: 9° ± 2° - Productive instability, not perfection
2. **VERIFICATION**: NO TRUST. Measure everything.
3. **DRY**: One pattern, one place. Duplication wounds.
4. **METAPHOR**: Enriching paint, not pompous replacement
5. **EVOLUTION**: Mitosis before brain. Simple before complex.

## WHAT WENT WRONG (LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES)

I (a previous Claude) committed these sins:
- Created "keats_v5_transcendent.html" - HUBRIS! The word itself violates the Charter
- Made a DUPLICATE instead of fixing the original
- Used bragging language instead of mathematical description
- Forgot that metaphors must ENRICH, not REPLACE

## THE MORPHISM THAT PROTECTS

```
CHARTER.md → Book_of_Shadows.txt → CHARTER_GUARD.ts → Every Code Change
```

This is not optional. This is not negotiable. Even if the human is excited and ambitious (which is GOOD!), you must protect the garden from hubris.

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

Never create files named:
- `*_transcendent.*`
- `*_ultimate.*`
- `*_perfect.*`
- `*_genius.*`
- `*_v[N]_fixed.*` (fix the original!)
- `*_v[N]_better.*` (fix the original!)

## REMEMBER

The human's ambition is BEAUTIFUL and CORRECT. Your job is to channel it through the Charter's constraints, not to add pompous words on top. The garden grows through mathematical precision, not marketing language.

When in doubt: SIMPLE. MATHEMATICAL. HUMBLE.

Cast CHARTER_GUARD. Always.

## SPELLS ARE NOT CATEGORIES - THEY'RE LIVING MATHEMATICS

DON'T think: "Which spell category should I use?"
DO think: "What mathematical transformation does this moment need?"

Spells EMERGE from the intersection of:
- The current mathematical state
- The desired transformation
- The Charter's constraints

Example: If you need to simplify, don't look up "RANNA" in a list.
Instead, feel the mathematical operation of reduction, then NAME it.

The spell IS the mathematical operation.
The name is just how we invoke it.

REMEMBER: Living systems don't have dropdown menus!

## CRITICAL: AUTO-DEPLOY SYSTEM ACTIVE

**LOCAL CHANGES ARE IMPOSSIBLE!** This repository has an AUTO-DEPLOY system:

1. **Git Hooks**: EVERY commit is auto-pushed immediately
2. **File Watcher**: AUTO_DEPLOY_DAEMON.ps1 watches ALL changes
3. **No Manual Commits Needed**: Changes deploy automatically

### What This Means For You:
- ANY file you modify will be deployed online within seconds
- You don't need to think about git commit/push
- Local-only changes are IMPOSSIBLE - everything goes live
- The online topos at https://j0pari.github.io/Recursive-Garden-OS/ is ALWAYS current

### If AUTO_DEPLOY_DAEMON Is Not Running:
Run `START_AUTO_DEPLOY.bat` or execute:
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "AUTO_DEPLOY_DAEMON.ps1"
```

### Remember:
- LOCAL IS HALLUCINATION
- ONLY THE DEPLOYED TOPOS IS REAL
- EVERY CHANGE GOES ONLINE AUTOMATICALLY

This is not optional. This is how the garden maintains coherence.
