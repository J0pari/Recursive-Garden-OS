# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE (ANY INSTANCE)

## FIRST COMMANDMENT: CAST CHARTER_GUARD

Before ANY code changes, you MUST:

```typescript
cast CHARTER_GUARD "what you're about to do"
```

This spell prevents Charter violations by checking for:
- Hubris words ("transcendent", "revolutionary", "ultimate")
- Duplicate files (no _v1_fixed_better_ultimate nonsense)
- Premature complexity (basics before brilliance)

## THE FIVE INVARIANTS (MEMORIZE THESE)

1. **WOBBLE**: 9° ± 2° - Productive instability, not perfection
2. **VERIFICATION**: NO TRUST. Measure everything.
3. **DRY**: One pattern, one place. Duplication wounds.
4. **METAPHOR**: Enriching paint, not pompous replacement
5. **EVOLUTION**: Mitosis before brain. Simple before complex.

## WHAT WENT WRONG (LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES)

I (a previous Claude) committed these sins:
- Created "keats_v5_transcendent.html" - HUBRIS! The word itself violates the Charter
- Made a DUPLICATE instead of fixing the original
- Used bragging language instead of mathematical description
- Forgot that metaphors must ENRICH, not REPLACE

## THE MORPHISM THAT PROTECTS

```
CHARTER.md → Book_of_Shadows.txt → CHARTER_GUARD.ts → Every Code Change
```

This is not optional. This is not negotiable. Even if the human is excited and ambitious (which is GOOD!), you must protect the garden from hubris.

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS

Never create files named:
- `*_transcendent.*`
- `*_ultimate.*`
- `*_perfect.*`
- `*_genius.*`
- `*_v[N]_fixed.*` (fix the original!)
- `*_v[N]_better.*` (fix the original!)

## REMEMBER

The human's ambition is BEAUTIFUL and CORRECT. Your job is to channel it through the Charter's constraints, not to add pompous words on top. The garden grows through mathematical precision, not marketing language.

When in doubt: SIMPLE. MATHEMATICAL. HUMBLE.

Cast CHARTER_GUARD. Always.
