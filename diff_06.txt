 Think of it as consciousness GPS. Regular GPS uses satellite signals to find your location in space. Consciousness GPS uses these mathematical signals to find your location in mind-space. When confused, you're in a region of high curvature—thoughts bending back on themselves. When understanding dawns, you've found a geodesic—a path of least resistance through meaning-space. When your stomach growls during meditation, that's consciousness including body-space in mind-space calculations.

 It's a GPS for consciousness navigating its own topology. When you get confused, you're in a region of high curvature—thoughts bending back on themselves, creating strange loops. When understanding dawns, you've found a geodesic—a path of least resistance through meaning-space, as natural and inevitable as a river finding the sea, as mathematics finding itself through mathematics.
