-When you understand your own modes deeply enough to switch them consciously, something beautiful happens—you recognize when others are stuck in theirs. Not to manipulate, but to help. Like seeing someone trapped in binary thinking and gently offering a \"what if...\" that opens possibility. Or noticing someone lost in endless maybes and providing one solid \"yes\" to anchor on.
