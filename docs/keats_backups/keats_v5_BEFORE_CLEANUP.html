         * 
         * PROJECT OVERVIEW:
         * KEATS (Knowledge Engine for Topological Systems) is a multi-stratum
         * mathematical analysis and visualization platform designed to explore
         * mathematical concepts through interactive 3D visualization, natural language
         * processing, and symbolic computation. The system implements a structured
         * approach to mathematical reasoning that combines geometric visualization,
         * algebraic computation, and logical analysis.
         * 
         * CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION - RIGOROUS TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:
         * The system implements five computational modules, each with specific mathematical
         * purposes, significant limitations, and clear rationales for inclusion:
         * 
         * 1. E8 LIE GROUP VISUALIZATION MODULE (H0 Stratum):
         *    WHY E8: E8 is the largest exceptional simple Lie group, with 248 roots forming
         *    a mathematically consistent structure. It appears in string theory and provides
         *    a rich testbed for high-dimensional visualization techniques.
         *    
         *    ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION: 
         *    - JavaScript E8LieGroup class with hardcoded 248 root vectors in 8D space
         *    - Three.js particle system rendering projected roots as 3D points
         *    - Simple rotation matrices for user interaction (not proper SO(8) rotations)
         *    - Basic geometric primitives (spheres, lines) for visual representation
         *    
         *    MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS (CRITICAL):
         *    - NO implementation of Lie algebra structure [e_i, e_j] = sum(c_ijk * e_k)
         *    - NO proper 8D to 3D projection (uses naive coordinate dropping)
         *    - NO representation theory (weight spaces, character computations)
         *    - NO connection to exceptional Jordan algebra or octonions
         *    - Roots are static arrays, not computed from Cartan matrix
         *    - Missing: Weyl group action, root system properties, Dynkin diagram
         * 
         * 2. P-ADIC NUMBER SYSTEM MODULE (Mathematical Infrastructure):
         *    WHY P-ADIC: P-adic numbers provide alternative completions of rationals,
         *    essential for number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical logic.
         *    Different primes give different "distance" concepts, useful for analyzing
         *    mathematical structures from multiple perspectives.
         *    
         *    CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION (SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED):
         *    - Enhanced PAdicField class with proper field operations (+, -, ×, ÷, inverse)
         *    - Correct ultrametric topology with distance functions
         *    - Basic Hensel lifting for polynomial root finding
         *    - Proper valuation theory and p-adic normalization
         *    - Teichmuller representatives and canonical lifting
         *    - Extended prime support with mathematical validation
         *    
         *    REMAINING MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS (HONEST ASSESSMENT):
         *    - FINITE precision only (not true infinite precision p-adic numbers)
         *    - BASIC Hensel lifting (not optimized for complex polynomials)
         *    - NO advanced p-adic analysis (logarithms, exponentials, special functions) 
         *    - NO full integration with research-grade p-adic libraries
         *    - COMPUTATIONAL limitations for heavy operations (needs Web Workers)
         *    - Missing: Advanced p-adic modular forms, L-functions, deeper number theory
         *    - Status: Substantial improvement - authentic p-adic arithmetic for education/prototypes
         * 
         * 3. MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT RECOGNITION MODULE (H1 Stratum):
         *    WHY NLP FOR MATHEMATICS: Natural language often contains implicit mathematical
         *    structures. Extracting formal mathematical content from informal descriptions
         *    enables broader accessibility and automated mathematical reasoning.
         *    
         *    ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:
         *    - AdvancedNLPEngine class with mathematical keyword dictionaries
         *    - Pattern matching against predefined mathematical term lists
         *    - Basic tokenization and frequency analysis of mathematical concepts
         *    - Simple semantic scoring based on term co-occurrence
         *    
         *    MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS (FUNDAMENTAL):
         *    - NO mathematical parsing (cannot extract equations, formal statements)
         *    - NO semantic understanding of mathematical relationships
         *    - NO integration with computer algebra systems or proof assistants
         *    - NO mathematical knowledge representation or reasoning
         *    - Missing: Mathematical entity recognition, theorem statement parsing
         *    - Just keyword matching, not genuine mathematical language processing
         * 
         * 4. COMPUTATIONAL TOPOLOGY MODULE (H2 Stratum):
         *    WHY TOPOLOGY: Topological invariants capture global properties of mathematical
         *    structures that survive continuous deformations. Persistent homology reveals
         *    multi-scale geometric features in data and mathematical objects.
         *    
         *    ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:
         *    - TopologicalProcessor class with simplified homology computation
         *    - Basic persistence diagram generation for point cloud data
         *    - Elementary Betti number calculation (counting holes)
         *    - Simple cohomology operations on discrete structures
         *    
         *    MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS (EXTENSIVE):
         *    - NO proper simplicial complex construction or manipulation
         *    - NO spectral sequences for computing homology of fibrations
         *    - NO sheaf cohomology or derived functor computation
         *    - NO connection to algebraic topology (homotopy groups, fiber bundles)
         *    - Missing: Chain complexes, exact sequences, universal coefficients
         *    - Persistence diagrams lack proper filtration theory foundation
         * 
         * 5. MODAL LOGIC EVALUATION MODULE (Logical Framework):
         *    WHY MODAL LOGIC: Mathematical reasoning often involves necessity and
         *    possibility concepts. Modal logic provides formal tools for reasoning
         *    about mathematical possibility, necessity, and counterfactual scenarios.
         *    
         *    ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION:
         *    - ModalLogicEngine class with basic necessity/possibility operators
         *    - Simple truth table evaluation for modal formulas
         *    - Basic consistency checking across possible world states
         *    - Elementary paradox detection through truth value analysis
         *    
         *    MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS (COMPLETE):
         *    - NO proper Kripke semantics or possible world structures
         *    - NO modal proof systems (K, T, S4, S5 axiom systems)
         *    - NO completeness or soundness theorems for implemented logic
         *    - NO connection to modal mathematics or mathematical modalities
         *    - Missing: Accessibility relations, frame correspondences, model theory
         *    - Just boolean operations with modal labels, not genuine modal logic
         * 
         * TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE - ACTUAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
         * The system uses a stratified architecture where each stratum handles
         * specific computational tasks. However, "cross-stratum communication"
         * is largely cosmetic - modules operate mostly independently.
         * 
         * STRATUM H0 (GEOMETRIC VISUALIZATION):
         * - E8LieGroup class: Stores 248 hardcoded 8D vectors, renders as 3D particles
         * - MathematicalRenderer: Three.js wrapper with basic camera controls
         * - ParticleSystem: Simple THREE.Points objects with basic materials
         * - Camera controls: Standard Three.js orbit controls, not mathematical transformations
         * REALITY: Basic 3D visualization engine, not mathematical Lie group computation
         *

         * - AdvancedNLPEngine: Keyword matching against mathematical term dictionaries
         * - SemanticProcessor: Frequency counting and basic pattern recognition

         * - LogicalProcessor: Boolean operations with mathematical labels
         * - "Paradox resolution": Inconsistency detection through truth table comparison
         * - "Cross-stratum coherence": Simple state synchronization, not mathematical coherence
         * REALITY: Elementary computational logic, not topological or formal reasoning
         * 
         * MODAL LOGIC STRATUM:
         * - ModalLogicEngine: Boolean evaluation with necessity/possibility labels
         * - Truth value management: Simple state machines, not modal model theory
         * - "Dynamic logic switching": Parameter changes, not formal logic transformation
         * - "Consistency maintenance": Basic conflict detection, not modal consistency
         * REALITY: Labeled boolean logic, not authentic modal logical reasoning
         * 
         * SYSTEM MANAGEMENT:
         * - SystemManager: JavaScript object coordination and DOM manipulation
         * - State management: JSON serialization of JavaScript objects
         * - Telemetry collection: Event logging with basic compression
         * - Plugin architecture: Simple function registration system
         * REALITY: Web application framework, not mathematical system architecture

         ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         
         This HTML implements a multi-layered mathematical interface:
         1. Mathematical Canvas: Three.js 3D visualization layer
         2. Stratum Panels: Interactive control interfaces for each mathematical layer
         3. System Management: Global controls and monitoring
         4. Notification System: Real-time feedback and alerts
         
         MODIFICATION GUIDE:
         - Canvas Layer: Modify mathematical-space for 3D visualization changes
         - Panel System: Add new stratum-panel divs for additional mathematical layers
         - Control Integration: Extend panel-content for new parameter controls
         - Event Handling: See JavaScript section for interaction logic

         MATHEMATICAL VISUALIZATION LAYER: Three.js Canvas Container
         ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
         PURPOSE: Provides WebGL-accelerated 3D rendering surface for mathematical
         object visualization using Three.js framework.
         
         TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
         - HTML5 Canvas element with WebGL context for hardware acceleration
         - Three.js Scene, Camera, Renderer initialization target
         - Touch and mouse event capture for 3D navigation controls
         - Responsive sizing with viewport-based dimensions
         
         LIMITATIONS:
         - Single canvas approach limits multi-scene complexity
         - No WebXR integration for immersive mathematical exploration
         - Fixed projection from higher-dimensional mathematical objects

         ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         
         ARCHITECTURAL PURPOSE:
         Multi-panel interface system providing stratified access to different
         mathematical computation layers. Each panel represents a specific
         mathematical domain with dedicated controls and real-time metrics.
         
         PANEL HIERARCHY:
         - H0 (Geometric): 3D visualization and spatial mathematical structures
         - H1 (Semantic): Natural language processing and mathematical concept recognition
         - H2 (Logical): P-adic field theory and topological analysis computations
         - Analysis Engine: Text processing and mathematical content extraction
         - System Management: Global coordination and performance monitoring
         - Modal Logic: Necessity/possibility operators and logical transformations
         
         INTERACTION MODEL:
         - Collapsible panels with preserved state across user sessions
         - Real-time metric updates from JavaScript computation engines
         - Parameter controls with immediate mathematical computation feedback
         - Cross-panel mathematical state synchronization

         H0 STRATUM: Geometric Foundation Layer - Three.js Visualization Interface
         ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
         MATHEMATICAL PURPOSE: Controls for 3D geometric visualization including
         E8 Lie group root system display, particle system density, manifold
         curvature parameters, and geometric transformation operations.
         
         TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:
         - E8 root system visualization with 248 projected points in 3D space
         - Particle density adjustment for mathematical object representation
         - Manifold curvature parameter control (simplified scalar curvature)
         - Flow field visualization for vector field mathematical structures
         
         MATHEMATICAL LIMITATIONS:
         - "Manifold curvature" is visual parameter, not genuine Riemannian curvature
         - No proper differential geometry computation or geodesic calculations
         - E8 projection loses 5 dimensional information in 8D→3D mapping
         - Particle systems approximate continuous mathematical structures
         
         USER CONTROLS:
         - Particle Density: Adjusts number of rendered points (1K-15K range)
         - Manifold Curvature κ: Visual deformation parameter (0.1-8.0 range)
         - Flow Field Intensity: Vector field visualization strength
         - Animation Toggle: Start/stop continuous geometric transformations
         - Force Application: Impulse-based particle system perturbation

                 - Logical events are system notifications, not formal logical derivations

                 P-ADIC FIELD SELECTION: Authentic P-adic Number System Configuration
                 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                 PURPOSE: Selection of prime number base for authentic p-adic field computation.
                 Each prime creates a mathematically distinct p-adic number system Q_p.
                 
                 MATHEMATICAL REALITY (AFTER ENHANCEMENT):
                 - LABEL: "Q₂-adic Field" → REALITY: Authentic 2-adic number field operations
                 - LABEL: "Q₃-adic Field" → REALITY: Authentic 3-adic number field operations  
                 - LABEL: "Q₅-adic Field" → REALITY: Authentic 5-adic number field operations
                 - And so on for primes 7, 11, 13, 17...
                 
                 WHAT CHANGING THE PRIME ACTUALLY DOES:
                 ✅ Creates new PAdicField.one(prime, 20) with authentic p-adic operations
                 ✅ Updates visual amplification effects based on p-adic coherence metrics
                 ✅ Changes particle system heights, forces, and opacity
                 ✅ Modifies lighting system with prime-specific illumination patterns
                 ✅ Updates color themes via p-adic field color mappings
                 ✅ Triggers topological analysis with new p-adic mathematical context
                 
                 CURRENT MATHEMATICAL CAPABILITIES:
                 ✅ Proper p-adic field operations (+, -, ×, ÷, inverse) with finite precision
                 ✅ Ultrametric topology with correct distance functions  
                 ✅ Basic Hensel lifting and valuation theory
                 ✅ Visual integration of p-adic mathematical properties
                 
                 LIMITATIONS REMAIN:
                 ⚠️ Finite precision only (not infinite precision p-adic numbers)
                 ⚠️ No advanced p-adic analysis (transcendentals, L-functions)
                 ⚠️ Visual effects are educational/artistic, not rigorous mathematical representation

         * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
         * 
         * COMPUTATIONAL PHILOSOPHY: This class provides a computational interface to 
         * elementary modal logic concepts (necessity □, possibility ◇) suitable for
         * interactive artistic and educational experiences. The implementation is
         * deliberately simplified and focuses on user engagement rather than formal
         * logical rigor.
         * 
         * MATHEMATICAL HONESTY: ⚠️ WARNING - HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED MODAL LOGIC ⚠️
         * • Uses elementary arithmetic rather than formal modal model semantics
         * • Modal resonance calculation is heuristic, not logically grounded
         * • Cross-strata integration is metaphorical rather than mathematically precise
         * • No actual Kripke models, accessibility relations, or modal frame validation
         * • Necessity/possibility operators are UI metaphors, not logical operators
         * 
         * FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS:
         * 1. Formal modal model construction with Kripke semantics
         * 2. Integration with automated theorem proving for modal logic
         * 3. Implementation of S4, S5, and other modal logic systems
         * 4. Dynamic epistemic logic for knowledge update modeling
         * 5. Temporal logic extensions for time-dependent modal reasoning
         * 
         * PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS:
         * • Leibnizian possible worlds metaphysics inspiration
         * • Simplified Kripke semantics for accessibility relations
