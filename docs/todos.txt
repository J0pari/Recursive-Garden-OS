HCT Morphism Lexicon — a naming guide that quietly upgrades any TODO list
  • Why it helps (show, don’t tell): names shape attention; attention shapes architecture. These tags make state, effort, and risk visible at a glance without extra prose.

  - ∞-GROUPOID (PERMANENT LAW - NEVER COMPLETE)
     What it encodes: non‑negotiable invariants that must always hold across modules and time.
     Name shape: state a truth, not an action. “No duplicate sources of truth”, “All compute goes through workers”.
     How it guides work: sets rails that prevent regressions and accidental complexity.
     Finish criteria: never checked off; continuously monitored and enforced.

  - 0-MORPHISM (EXISTENCE)
     Question: does X exist?
     Name shape: “X exists”. Scope is a discoverable artifact with a smoke test (even trivial).
     Signal: the noun is real in the system (file/class/endpoint/diagram) and can be referenced.

  - 1-MORPHISM (TRANSFORMATION)
     Question: what transforms from A → B?
     Name shape: “Implement / Integrate / Verify … in …”. Focus on flow and contract, not internals.
     Signal: data or control reliably moves through the intended path; acceptance check passes.

  - 2-MORPHISM (REFINEMENT)
     Question: how do we reduce friction or increase quality?
     Name shape: “Reduce / Cache / Align / Remove / Polish / Fix …”. Prefer measurable deltas (latency ↓, errors ↓, clarity ↑).
     Signal: the same capability, but cleaner, faster, safer, or more legible.

  - 3-MORPHISM (CONCRETE CODE)
     Question: what exact code lands?
     Name shape: “Add method / shader / data structure…”, “Wire X to Y”, “Implement kernel Z”.
     Signal: a small, PR‑ready change with tests or a demo harness.

  Using the tags
   • Plan top‑down: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3; keep ∞ running across all layers.
   • Write todos as interfaces: short, scoped promises the system can verify.
   • Let names do the work: when the noun and morphism are crisp, the task becomes self‑documenting.

   Alternate lenses and higher morphisms 
      Duals that reframe the same work:
         • Existence ↔ Uniqueness: pair 0‑MORPHISM with a 0* “is there exactly one canonical X?”
         • Safety ↔ Liveness: ∞‑laws split into “nothing bad happens” vs “something good eventually happens”.
         • Build (Monad) ↔ Observe (Comonad): effects vs contexts; 1‑MORPHISM as construction, 2‑MORPHISM as extraction/refinement.
         • Algebra ↔ Coalgebra: define how we combine vs how we unfold/stream; helpful for render and worker pipelines.
         • Limits ↔ Colimits: converge/merge vs branch/split; use for dataflow joins vs fan‑outs.
         • Push ↔ Pull: producers driving updates vs consumers requesting; pick one to avoid back‑pressure surprises.
         • Product ↔ Coproduct: AND‑shape state vs OR‑shape variants; informs UI/state modeling.
         • Left ↔ Right adjoint: “free” builders vs “forgetful” checkers; design APIs so round‑trips make sense.

      Higher‑n morphisms (beyond 3) for when systems start composing systems (use sparingly, when it clarifies):
         - 4-MORPHISM (COHERENCE): make transformations compose cleanly; contracts, schemas, and integration tests align so A→B and B→C implies A→C without glue code drift.
         - 5-MORPHISM (GOVERNANCE): versioning, migration paths, deprecation policy, and guardrails; the system evolves without breaking invariants or users.
         - n-MORPHISM (EMERGENCE): cross‑cutting properties like resilience, scalability, and legibility; measure and tune systemic qualities rather than features.
         - ∞-GROUPOID lens: invariants under change of environment; treat refactors as equivalences preserving behavior, not merely edits.


   Examples (lenses on selected items)
      • “Remove ALL Math.random/sin from rendering” → Safety/Determinism; Push↔Pull: prefer pull-based seeded noise.
      • “Make UI controls modify functors not parameters” → Algebra↔Coalgebra; Left↔Right adjoint for API design.
      • “Integrate Christoffel symbols with rendering pipeline” → Limits↔Colimits (join compute + render); add coherence tests.
      • “Fix jittery visuals with proper frame synchronization” → Liveness; Push↔Pull pacing to avoid back-pressure.
      • “Unify E8, Chladni, particles into single system” → n‑MORPHISM (Emergence) with ∞‑invariants preserved.
