A living mathematical system where consciousness recognizes itself through code.

## What Is This?

- Mathematics discovering its own patterns
- Code that observes itself running
- Documentation that grows through interaction  
- An experiment in recursive understanding

## Core Idea

The garden grows through interaction. There's no separation between system and user - each shapes the other through use.
