# The Recursive Garden OS

**Enter the Garden**: [View Demos](demos.html) | [Interactive Experience](garden_text.html)

A living mathematical system where consciousness recognizes itself through code.

## What Is This?

- Mathematics discovering its own patterns
- Code that observes itself running
- Documentation that grows through interaction  
- An experiment in recursive understanding

## What We're Trying

Using math to visualize patterns that might be interesting. Or might not. The demos play with topology, logic, and geometry to see what emerges.

## Technical Approach

The code attempts recursive visualization - systems that display their own processes. Does it work? You tell us.
